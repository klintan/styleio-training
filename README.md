This will prepare a range of images to be used for image search.


What could be done in the future to improve?
- Try out different features
- Try out different parameters on different features
- Try out vocabulary size
- Try out histogram equalization, of image, of the resulting histogram.


ToDo
- A configuration file for each run, one config-template and one config-file which is saved with a timestamp for each unique run
- Every file saved (vocab, comparison, folder created etc) should add the same unique timestamp and id for that specific run (connected to the config file)

- Check sorting for deep learning sorting (sorting on highest number or lowest number as most similar), add parameter if it needs changing.
